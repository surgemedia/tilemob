        The Company&rsquo;s responsibility for damage to, or shortage of,
        the Goods ceases upon dispatch or pickup from the Company&rsquo;s
        premises.
      <LI> The Company reserves the right to
        subcontract commercial carriers to deliver Goods on the Customer&rsquo;s
        behalf and at the Customer&rsquo;s risk.

        discretion delivery of the Goods shall take place when the Customer
        takes possession of the Goods at the Customer&rsquo;s nominated
        address (in the event that the Goods are delivered by the Company

      <LI> The Customer shall make all
        arrangements necessary to take delivery of the Goods whenever they
        are tendered for delivery. In the event that the Customer is unable

        entitled to charge a reasonable fee for redelivery.
      <LI> Delivery of the Goods to a third

        deliver the Goods (or any of them) promptly or at all, where due to
        circumstances beyond the control of the Company.
      <LI> The delivery records of the Company
        shall be prima facie proof of delivery of the Goods to the Customer

        destroyed following delivery but prior to ownership passing to the
        Customer, the Company is entitled to receive all insurance proceeds
        payable for the Goods. The production of these terms and conditions
        by the Company is sufficient evidence of the Company&rsquo;s rights
        to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person
        dealing with the Company to make further enquiries.

        requests the Company to leave Goods outside the Company&rsquo;s
        premises for collection or to deliver the Goods to an unattended
        location then such Goods shall be left at the Customer&rsquo;s sole
        risk and it shall be the Customer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure
        the Goods are insured adequately or at all.
      <LI> If delivery is delayed as a
        consequence of the Customer&rsquo;s instructions, or lack thereof,
        then the Company may at its sole discretion, store the Goods for
        the Customer (at the Customer&rsquo;s risk) and the Customer shall
        be liable for all storage costs charged or incurred by the Company
        and in the event that the Goods are stored elsewhere all cartage
        charges incurred by the Company.

            product supplied, or to match batches of product to sales samples,
            catalogues, marketing literature or website images in order to
            minimise such variations but shall not be liable in any way

            products including but not limited to: terracotta, wood, stone,
            slate, marble, sandstone and granite are sold on the basis that

            significant variations in colour, physical dimensions, density,
            surface texture, slip-resistance and markings, veining and pattern

            effects only and do not affect the performance or life span of the

            Standard; and

      <LI> The Customer acknowledges and agrees
        that it is their responsibility to:
        <OL>
          <LI> Upon delivery and before laying,
            installation or use, to check and inspect all Goods for
            correctness of type, quantity, quality, aesthetics / appearance
            and suitability of purpose before installation. In the case of
            tiles and items sold by the square metre, or designed to cover a
            surface, these Goods should be laid out to dry (without adhesive)
            in final situ with adequate lighting for inspection and approval
            of the Goods. In cases where the Customer is a re-seller or trade
            contractor procuring the Goods and arranging their installation
            for a client, or on-selling the Goods, the final intended owner(s)
            of the Goods should always conduct and be present for this
            inspection of the Goods prior to approving laying, installation or
            use of the same. NOTE: The act of laying, installing and using the
            Goods constitutes the Customer&rsquo;s full and unconditional
            acceptance and approval of all the characteristics of the Goods in
            all regards. No claims whatsoever will be accepted in regard to
            correctness of type, quantity, quality, aesthetics / appearance,
            and suitability of purpose after laying, installation or use; and
          <LI> ensure that the method by which the
            Customer, or their subcontractor, proposes to install or apply the
            Goods are in accordance with accepted industry standards (e.g.
            AS3958.1-2007 or its successor Standards), are satisfactory for
            the purpose intended, and that all instructions issued by the
            manufacturer of the Goods, adhesive, grout and other incidental
            materials used are precisely followed (and safe-work practices)
            are followed during installation, including but not limited to:
            use of eye and hearing protection, observation of electrical
            safety; and
          <LI> ensure that a receipt note is
            obtained from the Company on delivery.  Goods shall not be
            accepted for return or as a defect if no receipt note can be shown
            by the Customer; and
          <LI> ensure that sufficient Goods are
            purchased to complete the works.  The Company cannot guarantee the
            ongoing or future supply of any Goods.  Quantity estimates of
            Goods required, and provided to the Customer by the Company, their
            employees or associates are purely estimates, and as such, the
            Company will not accept any liability for any shortfall or
            oversupply of Goods; and
          <LI> maintain the Goods after laying,
            installation or use in ways including but not limited to:
            observing a proper cleaning regimen, keeping abrasive materials
            (e.g. sand) away from the Goods, protecting Goods from impact
            damage by foreign objects, and keeping natural stone tiles, marble
            tiles, slate, terracotta tiles, porcelain tiles or other porous
            Goods properly sealed at all times so that water &ldquo;beads&rdquo;

        absolute discretion) re-delivering the Goods or equivalent Goods
        (no installation, re-installation, removal or labour charges of any
        kind are payable) or repairing the Goods except where the Customer

        Practices Act 1974 (CWlth) or the Fair Trading Acts of the relevant

        as first quality to actually be firsts. This requirement is less
        than one hundred percent (100%) to allow for a margin of human
        error. Defects which render tiles second quality may include but
        are not limited to: minor chips, glaze faults, shading variation,
        specks and spots (etc); and are all aesthetic rather than
        structural, and hence a second quality tile will have the same
        physical performance as first quality tiles without the same
        appearance characteristics. It should be noted that with some
        surface blemishes such as spots and specks, the actual size of the
        spot or speck which is acceptable as either a first or second
        quality will vary from tile type to tile type, depending on colour,
        pattern, surface treatment and intended application.
      <LI> EN1469 (Natural Stone Products for
