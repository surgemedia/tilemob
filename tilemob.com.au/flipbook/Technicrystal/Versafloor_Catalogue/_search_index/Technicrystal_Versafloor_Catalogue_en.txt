GREEN TILE

A BETTER TILE FOR OUR GREEN ENVIRONMENT

- VERSAFLOORTM tile is a green environmentally friendly product when compared

to other porcelain tiles in the market. VERSAFLOORTM tile consists of two very distinctive layers of clay pressed together and fired at a high temperature to form one solid full body porcelain tile. The top layer, which makes up the true color and surface finish of the tile, requires less additives and color pigment and with the main remaining body made in neutral clay, recycled or broken tiles are added to the mix.
